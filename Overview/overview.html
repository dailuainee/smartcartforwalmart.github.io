				<h1>Overview</h1>
				<p>The SmartCart is a tablet, card reader, and scanning device that can be attached and
					deattached from Walmart shopping carts. Once a customer walks in a Walmart store, they are
					provided with a sanitized shopping cart attached with a SmartCart device. They can use these
					tablets to scan their items, look up items within the store, help navigate them through the store,
					and complete a transaction once they are finished shopping. Upon exiting the store,
					the SmartCart is detached with the assistance of a Walmart employee, in which the Walmart employee
					takes the SmartCart device and stores it away for cleaning.
				</p>

				<h2>Safe and Sanitary</h2>
				<p>With the way society currently faces a pandemic due to the COVID-19 outbreak (as well as rising variants), 
					our world is shifting towards a need to be as sanitary as possible. Right now, it is ideal for places 
					that deal with large amounts of people everyday (like Walmart) to be as contactless as possible. 
					Having mobile tablet scanners that people use can reduce the amount of contact Walmart workers have with 
					customers, ensuring the safety of both parties involved.

				<h2>Customer Convenience</h2>
				<p> Walmart customers can checkout at any time they would like, seeing as the tablet would feature a card 
					swiper/inserter at the sides. This saves the customer time by not having 
					to wait in line at checkout stations.

				<h2>Striving Towards Eco-friendliness</h2>
				<p> While there will be stations set up within the store that are equipped with plastic bags for customers to grab 
					and use prior to their exit, customers can be encouraged to pack groceries in their car using their own respective 
					carriers (i.e laundry baskets, package boxes, reusable bags, etc.).
